# Google API's Starter Set: Sheets
## Questionnaire Prototype &mdash; simple yes or no question/answer format for quizzes or tests.
## A/B Test Prototype &mdash; compare the performance of two layouts.

For my own reference: Uses Google Sheets & Forms for an application DB. Google Analytics Experiement to facilitate A/B test. POC for scoreboard components (leaderboard, weighted scoring, scatter chart).

SCOREBOARD: https://jessekorzan.github.io/qUizList/scoreboard/

jQuery is a dependency.

Review simple demo; list of "colours" to verify are correct, code randomly throws in false answers.

Highlights:
- customize the JSON for different test/quizes (easy to see how to change in code)
- watch Oprah add up the final score
- has a timer!
- saves results to google form
- layout variant
- scoreboard
