# qUizList
## UI Prototype &mdash; simple yes or no question/answer format for quizzes or tests.

The real highlight (regardless of what you read below) is using Google Sheets & Forms for an application DB. Should be easy to understand the javascript. Useful for prototyping. Submit an issue if you have q's.

jQuery is a dependency.

Review simple demo; list of "colours" to verify are correct, code randomly throws in false answers.

Highlights:
- customize the JSON for different test/quizes (easy to see how to change in code)
- watch Oprah add up the final score
- has a timer!
- saves results to google form
- two layouts
