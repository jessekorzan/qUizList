# qUizList
## UI Prototype &mdash; simple yes or no question/answer format for quizzes or tests.

The highlight here is probably showing how to use Google Sheets/Forms for a DB for an application. Dead easy to understand. Reading not included.

DEMO: https://jessekorzan.github.io/qUizList/

Review simple demo; list of "colours" to verify are correct, code randomly throws in false answers.

Highlights:
- customize the JSON for different test/quizes (easy to see how to change in code)
- watch Oprah add up the final score
- has a timer!
- saves results to google form
